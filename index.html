    <h1>Hey fellow disgruntled trainers!</h1>
    <p> My name's Shane, and I'm 14 years old. I set out to make this game in hopes of alerting Niantic of the severity of the communities disdain for current spawning mechanics.</p>
    <p>C'mon, Niantic, I've literally managed to teach myself Javascript just to make a statement regarding the lack of Pokemon in suburban/rural areas in Pokemon GO! (granted, if my game were a Pidgey, by comparison, yours would be a Dragonite, so full
      marks for... most of what you've done with GO)</p>
    <p>If you'd like to help me in my plight, share this game on your Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or all three! (if you're one of the two people left on earth who still use Google+) Here some conveniant links if you want to do that now.</p>

    <p>Additionally, if you want to help me keep the servers up and running so you never again have to see the sentence "Our servers are experiencing issues. Please come back later." (...whoops), consider donating below in the name of your team. My allowance
      can only support the game for so long. I'll have a special version of this game for the team that donates the most by 9/5/2016 at 8:00 est. </p>
